    The Dewey Decimal Classification (or Dewey Decimal System) is a library classification system designed by Melvil Dewey in 1876 and maintained by OCLC. It sorts topics into ten major classes, and hierarchically divides into more specific subclasses with a 3-digit whole number, and an added decimal for a more precise division. Cutter numbers and publication years are used to distinguish between specific books.

    The complete Dewey Decimal schedule can be found on the OCLC website. For this app, only the whole-number subdivisions are used.
