    The Library of Congress Classification was developed in 1897 to organize the Library of Congress' collection. It is divided into 21 single-letter classes, or topics, which are further divided into subclasses and subdivisions. Books within the same subclass can be distinguished with Cutter numbers and publication years.

    The Library of Congress offers a paid service called Classification Web to search their classification in greater detail, as well as a free distribution page that offers the classification in PDF format, called FreeLCC.

    FreeLCC describes the classes in three levels of detail: the Preface offers a broad overview of what the class contains, the Outline provides a general description of how the class is broken up, and the Text details precisely how a topic can be cataloged within that class. The information in this app uses FreeLCC's Outline documents.
